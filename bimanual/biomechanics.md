## Fine-Manipulation Task

##### Hand pose selection in a bimanual fine-manipulation task

[Link](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00635.2020); Study of human performing fine-manipulation task: watch making. There is some important conclusions: 1. hand dominance strongly influenced role-distribution of task, 2. subjects manifested strong preference for bimanual over unimanual manipulation, 3. hand pose selection strategy can reduce variability and alleviate intrinsic sensorimotor processing burdens
