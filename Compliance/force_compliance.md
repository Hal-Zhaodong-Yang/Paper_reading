# Force Compliance



##### SoftMimic

[link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17792); leverage an inverse kinematics solver to generate an augmented dataset of feasible compliant motions, which they use to train an RL policy; Policy observes user input stiffness, original human motion demo, and sensor data, but it is rewarded with matching the augmented target generated by the inverse kinematics solver 

- Compliant motion tracking: minimize the difference between current posture and desired posture, as well as the desired compliant target pose (computed using a stiffness) 
- IK solver: An non-linear optimization solver that optimize several objectives
