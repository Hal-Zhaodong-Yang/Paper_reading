# Force Compliance



##### SoftMimic

[link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17792); leverage an inverse kinematics solver to generate an augmented dataset of feasible compliant motions, which they use to train an RL policy; Policy observes user input stiffness, original human motion demo, and sensor data, but it is rewarded with matching the augmented target generated by the inverse kinematics solver 

- Compliant motion tracking: minimize the difference between current posture and desired posture, as well as the desired compliant target pose (computed using a stiffness) 
- IK solver: An non-linear optimization solver that optimize several objectives



##### Variable Impedance Control

[link](https://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss06/p20.pdf); Path Integral is a concept in quantum physics, robotics use it to sample trajectories and choose the weighted average of all the sampled trajectories as the optimal solution; For their method, Policy Improvement with Path Integral, they use DMP to represents the policy and update DMP parameters by the cost of each trajectory produced by DMP. And they use basis function to represent the scheduling of PD gains in the PD controller, to generate different variable impedance.

- Their impedance are just determined by the PD gains, not depending on external forces.
